      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Koeksisters are a South African tea time snack made of light dough similar to doughnuts which are plaited and doused in a lot of sweet syrup or honey. You can have make them as big or as small as you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll find them in your local corner bakery. They are sold all over the country, but mostly assocated with Western Cape Malay culture, where they have their own version, which is a fried ball of dough that is rolled in desiccated coconut.
